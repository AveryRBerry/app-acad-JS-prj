Background

This weather project is a solo endeavor focused on creating a straightforward weather webpage. The goal is to provide instant weather updates based on the user's location. The main display will offer essential information like current weather, temperature, and time of day. I'm also planning to incorporate a slider for easy switching between metric and imperial units.

To go beyond the basics, I'm building interactive features that allow users to explore more detailed weather data. Clickable elements will reveal specific insights such as wind speed, precipitation, UV index, and air quality. While I'm considering adding language preferences, my main focus is on creating a clean and functional interface.




Functionality & MVPs

This weather project will include the following core features, a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), and an aspirational feature:

Minimum Viable Product (MVP):

1. User-Friendly Interface: The MVP focuses on a straightforward user interface for easy navigation. It provides essential weather data in a clear manner, ensuring users can quickly understand current conditions.

2. Location-Based Data: Users can input or detect their location to retrieve relevant weather information. This feature ensures accuracy in displaying weather data.

3. Basic Weather Details: The MVP displays primary weather information, including current conditions and temperature, offering users instant insights.

Additional Features:

1. Interactive Weather Insights: Users can interact with UI elements to access more weather data. Clicking specific elements reveals details like wind speed, precipitation, UV index, and air quality, allowing users to explore deeper.

2. Unit Conversion: This feature lets users switch between metric (Celsius, meters per second) and imperial (Fahrenheit, miles per hour) units for a personalized experience.

Aspirational Feature:

1. Language Choices: As an aspirational goal, language options might be integrated. Users could select preferred languages, offering weather data in their chosen language.
